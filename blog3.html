                <h4 class="nitro-offscreen">If you&rsquo;d like to make your life brilliant&hellip;and who wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;I&rsquo;m going to ask you to take a break from your usual habits.</h4>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">I&rsquo;m talking about the usual thought habits you have,<a  rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;the usual reactions you have</a> and the usual and most likely unnoticed beliefs and assumptions you have. Those kind of habits.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">And if you have a logic-based brain, I&rsquo;m going to ask you to work at putting that aside, for now and let that creative you out for that blockbuster reality show that is lying in the wings waiting for some attention. Put away your rational mind and <em><strong>feel!</strong></em></p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Making your life brilliant is sort of about manifesting, but it&rsquo;s a deeper and dare I say a more spiritual, energy- connected way to go about it.</p>



<p class="nitro-offscreen">Much of what&rsquo;s written about creating and manifesting misses a vital ingredient. And it is the most vital ingredient in your success as an operator of the creative process, one that matters a lot.</p>



<p class="nitro-offscreen">And in my latest book The Power of Consciousness I share how I accidentally stumbled upon consciousness at work in my life and how, through trial and error I put into practice deliberate ways to use this power that lies in every one of us. And I provide a blueprint for you to begin to build your knowledge of consciousness at work in your world, if you&rsquo;re inclined for a bit of transformation in life too!</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen"><a  rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">You can find the book here,</a> and here&rsquo;s some excerpts so you can start to harness this power to create your brilliant life.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Let&rsquo;s get to it.</p>

<h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Excerpts from &ldquo;The Missing Link &ndash; The Power of Consciousness&rdquo;&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">&ldquo;Know it or not. Like it or not. You are always in the process of creating something <a  target="_blank">because your consciousness is always operating</a>. Deliberately or not. Purposefully or not. And believe me, purposeful operation is a much better way to go.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">You can&rsquo;t make your creative powers work more purposefully without understanding a bit about the energy of feelings and emotions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-background nitro-offscreen" style="background-color:#eceff3;">Wanting something, desiring something is merely a starting point and your<br>consciousness won&rsquo;t respond with creating that life while you continue to simply<br>desire. If you ever want to be really good at manifesting and keeping the things<br>you want in life, you have to work with your consciousness in the way it was<br>created to operate. &ndash; Elle Sommer</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">You can visualize, picture in your mind, expect, and ask until the cows come home. But without emotionalizing all that you would like to be or to have, you might as well be twiddling your thumbs.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Feelings and emotions are the only way to reach your subconscious mind, and your subconscious is the creative aspect of you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Your conscious mind can come up with the most brilliant ideas and dreams for your future but unless the subconscious is primed to create these ideas and dreams, it&rsquo;s pretty tough for them to become part of your &lsquo;real world&rsquo; experiences.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">If you&rsquo;re looking for the most powerful way to manifest a brilliant life, it&rsquo;s not possible to do so unless you have all the basic pieces of the puzzle of consciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Awareness</h2>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve separated the <em>What&nbsp;</em>from the <em>How</em> so you can get clear on the basic principles before jumping in to practicing various methods of using them. Which is why this book isn&rsquo;t called Using the Power of Consciousness!</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">You must become one who knows how consciousness works, which means you become one who has conscious awareness.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Why is this so? Because we don&rsquo;t get what we want &ndash; we actually get who we are. In other words, we can only get what we have in our consciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Who do you say you are?</h2>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in your consciousness? Who are you?</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen"><a  rel="noreferrer noopener">What beliefs do you have about yourself?</a> What are your predominant moods? Are you like me, somewhat disorganized? What kind of stories do you tell yourself? Do your thoughts wander around willy-nilly? Are you a worrier? Do you find lots of things to complain about?</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Every one of these ideas has a feeling attached to it. And those feelings determine what has been produced in your world.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Your world is a revelation reflector. It reveals you to you &ndash; what you have going on in your consciousness so you can change it if you want to.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Check your world today. Do you have lots of things you worry about? Are your actions and the results in your world all over the place? Do events happen on a regular basis that cause you to complain?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nitro-offscreen">The system that leads to a brilliant life</h2>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">&ldquo;The power of consciousness is a brilliant system, once we know of it and discover more about how it works, and how to practice making it work for us.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Your daily life is a mirror reflecting all that you have thought, imagined, and felt.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">This is because the dynamic duo of the conscious and subconscious act in concert with one another. The conscious mind produces the thoughts and ideas which once emotionalized or felt are transformed into your experiences of life by the subconscious &ndash; it still seems magical to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Why does the power of consciousness work?</h2>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">&ldquo;But how does the magic work? I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t particularly care. All the wondrous experiences that have been brought into my world through using the Power of Consciousness won&rsquo;t disappear because I don&rsquo;t know how it works.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">And whether I understand it or not, I have learned for myself that my subconscious has no choice but to get to work to produce in my outer world of reality an image that correlates to my feelings.</p>

<p class="nitro-offscreen">Once I discovered and practiced using this concept, my deepest desire was to be able to use it consistently and effectively. So I began to look for signs of land. To see if I could connect the dots between my inner and outer worlds.&rdquo;</p>
