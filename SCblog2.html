                <p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, keeping commitments to yourself isn&rsquo;t easy. Staying committed to others who are relying on us is simple enough, but <em>why is it so hard to keep those commitments to ourselves?</em></p>
<p>When I say keeping a commitment to yourself, I mean doing what you say you&rsquo;re going to do. If you say you&rsquo;re going to start waking up earlier, sticking up for yourself, working fewer hours, or eating better, those are commitments to yourself that no one else is going to do for you.</p>

<p>But if you&rsquo;re always setting goals and plans for yourself but can&rsquo;t seem to follow through with them, you&rsquo;re breaking the most important promise &ndash; the one with yourself. I found myself getting tired of doing this, so I decided it was time to keep the commitments I make for myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m sharing some thoughts I&rsquo;ve had about self-commitment and how I&rsquo;m shifting my mindset to prioritize my goals, especially when my doubts try to talk me out of things.</p>
<h2>Why do we break promises to ourselves?</h2>

<p><em>Why is keeping commitments to yourself so difficult? How come it&rsquo;s easier to keep commitments to other people? Why do we let ourselves down so often and prioritize everything else instead?</em></p>
<p>Maybe because we&rsquo;re taught that it&rsquo;s selfish to prioritize ourselves. The funny thing is, I KNOW deep down that it&rsquo;s not selfish to focus on my own needs. I don&rsquo;t consider people who go after their goals selfish (as long as it&rsquo;s not at the expense of others of course), yet it&rsquo;s something I still have trouble with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a problem of <a  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">limiting beliefs</a>; it&rsquo;s easy to think that we&rsquo;re not worthy of achieving or getting what we want. We talk ourselves out of things by thinking there are more important things to focus on. Even if we have the time, we find ways to avoid it.</p>
<p>We plan as if we&rsquo;re going to get what we want &mdash; we make lists of things we want to change, things we want to achieve, and the type of person we want to be. But when it comes to making the changes, the little step-by-step things to get us there, we chicken out.</p>
<h2>Yes, it&rsquo;s okay to focus on you</h2>

<p>The truth is that our goals are often lofty and perhaps outside of our comfort zone (which is a good thing!). The problem is when we set expectations that are too high for ourselves, or we become too afraid of failure that we avoid taking action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of believing in our needs and wants, we focus on our doubts instead. There might be a little voice in your head that says you&rsquo;ll ostracize yourself from others if you focus on pursuing what you want. If the people around you don&rsquo;t share the same goals as you, you might worry that they&rsquo;ll judge you (whether you succeed or fail).</p>
<p>In reality, learning to value your own goals and desires is the only way you&rsquo;ll be able to get to where you want to be. Not only does keeping commitments to yourself get you further ahead, but you&rsquo;ll also feel good about yourself because you kept a promise to yourself.</p>
<p>If a change needs to happen, you have to get a little uncomfortable by prioritizing yourself. It&rsquo;s okay to be selfish sometimes. No one else is going to stick up for your time and get the things done that you want to do, so it&rsquo;s important that you keep your promises to yourself.</p>
